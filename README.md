# Final_Assignment_Data_Capstone
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this module, you will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools you need to complete the course.

Week 1 = Data Collection (Webscraping and Wrangling). 
- Write Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas data frame.
- Convert a JSON file into a Create a Python Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file.
- Create a Jupyter notebook and make it sharable using GitHub.
- Use data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.
- Use your data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it.

Week 2 = Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL, Pandas and Matplotlib).
- Create scatter plots and bar charts by writing Python code to analyze data in a Pandas data frame.
- Write Python code to conduct exploratory data analysis by manipulating data in a Pandas data frame.
- Write and execute SQL queries to select and sort data.
- Use your data visualization skills to visualize the data and extract meaningful patterns to guide the modeling process.
